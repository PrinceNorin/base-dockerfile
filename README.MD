# Introduction

During the kick off/onboarding of every software projects, work required to setup a working development environment can sometime be a little time consuming especially if a project has many member working on it. As container technology becoming more popular every passing day, more and more organizations have migrate their development workflow to make use of this technology. I, myself, as a developer hate doing redundant thing and would like to be as lazy as possible, thus the birth of this seemingly useless repository.

# Goal

This repository contains customized base dockerfile configured for development environment of various programming languages/frameworks from my personal needed. The goal is to build a re-usable base image that comes bundled with pre-configure toolset needed to bootstrap a project faster during a development cycle. This is merely a personal collection so it will contains only techologies that I've used/worked/experimented with in the past that I deem there's a need for specialize image.

I will add more support for other languages/frameworks in the future, but if you, by any chance, found this repo useful and wanted to share your work feel free to contribute.
